// here (Integration has since fully migrated into modules/, so this is no
// longer blocked by namespace migration — it's a deliberate, disclosed
// trade-off). An earlier attempt to depend on a Shared SmsProvider contract
// instead was reverted: tests/Feature/Auth/NotificationFlowTest.php mocks
// SmsManager in the container via Mockery's `driver->send` demeter chaining,
// which doesn't satisfy an interface type-hint (the resulting demeter mock
// doesn't implement it). Fixing that cleanly means changing how that test
// mocks SMS delivery — a real test-authoring change, not something to force
// as a side effect of a migration pass.
